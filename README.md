Based on the above data the following are the findings:
- We can find the most rides in Urban than suburban than rulal.
- And we can see also the Urban have approximately five times driver count then Suburban.
- The total revenue from urban cities is the higher than Suburban and rural
- Rulal shows the highest average fare Per Ride therefore Suburban shows the second and Urban the third.
- the same for the average fare Per drive that shows the rural comes first then Suburban and Urban.

## Summary
- We need to increase the number of rides in rural areas to meet customer requierment.
- The average fare Per rides in rural area is higher than other areas so if we incrase the number of drivers count in rural areas,the fare per ride will possibly be less
